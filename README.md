# Deep Learning Challenge Analysis

# Overview of the analysis:
- The purpose of the analysis is to explain the accuracy of the model created to determine the successgulness of applicants if they were funded by Alphabet soup.

# Results:
**1. Through multiple attempts at the model, we were only able to reach an accuracy of 73%**

**2. Multiple attempts were unsucessful in significantly improving the accuracy of the model.**

**3. Further research and attempts are necessary, as well as potentially changing the model.**

# Data Preprocessing

**What variable(s) are the target(s) for your model?**

The successful applications.

**What variable(s) are the features for your model?**

Whether or not they were successful.

**What variable(s) should be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor 
features?**

EIN and NAME.

# Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

**How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?**

Four layers with 5-10 neurons and two different activation functions. Was trying whatever I could think of to improve accuracy but was unsucessful.

**Were you able to achieve the target model performance?**

No.

**What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance?**

Altering the number of layers, neurons, and activation types.

# Summary: 

**Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and then explain your recommendation.**

I was not able to reach a desired accuracy level. I'm honestly not sure how I could attempt to solve the problem, aside from continuing to play with the number of neurons and layers.
